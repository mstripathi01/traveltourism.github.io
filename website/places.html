      <h3>Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple</h3>
      <p>Located in the Kalupur area of Ahmedabad, Shri Swaminarayan Temple is a shrine dedicated to Narayan Dev. This splendid temple was built in the year 1822 on the instructions of Swaminarayan, who was the founder of the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism. Embellished with kaleidoscopic colours and intricate carvings, this temple is a marvellous example of the architecture of the nineteenth century. Inside the sanctum, the deities are decorated with ostentatious ornamentations and beautiful fabrics. The temple attracts a million people on the day after Diwali for darshan. 
The main complex of the temple is spread over a vast area making the spectacle of the temple a marvellous sight to behold. This temple is also the headquarter of the Nar Narayan Gadi, which makes it an even more revered temple among believers. Beautifully carved out of Burma Teak wood, the intricate detailing in the carvings of this temple make it an engineering masterpiece. The personal artefacts of Swami Narayan are also preserved for safe keeping here. The temple is also quite well known for its morning 'Aarti' or prayer service, which is a mesmerising invocation to the divine. The temple complex also has a multi-storey guesthouse and a medical clinic within its compound for the convenience of the visitors. Reflecting the many colours of spirituality, the Swami Narayan Temple is an unadulterated experience of the divine.</p>

      <h3>Dada Hari Wav</h3>
      <p>Built by a woman of Sultan Begara's harem in 1499AD, these step-wells were made as a retreat during hot summers. Waiting to be filled with rain water, no matter what the weather is, it is always cooler within the Step-wells.
This ancient structure depicts the architecture of the bygone era. At ground level, much might not be visible. But as one rises just a little (with the help of stairs) there is suddenly a deep cascade of steps plunging down several stories, intricate carvings reflecting in the sunlight.</p>

      <h3>Sabarmati Ashram</h3>
      <p>Once the residence of Mahatma Gandhi and his wife Kasturba, Sabarmati Ashram is undoubtedly the biggest tourist attraction situated in the suburb of Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Located on the tranquil and serene stretch of Sabarmati River, it was also referred to as the 'Gandhi Ashram', 'Mahatma Gandhi Ashram' and most importantly, 'Satyagraha Ashram' as Gandhi began the famous 'Dandi March' from here. In gratitude of the substantial impact Dandi march had on the Indian independence movement, the Indian government has recognized the Ashram as a national monument. 
The Mahatma Gandhi Ashram has a number of other establishments within its bounds. The most famous among them is the museum 'Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya' which has some of Gandhi's personal letters and photographs on display. The museum was initially located in Hridaya Kunj, Gandhi's own hut in the ashram, but was formally shifted here when the museum was built in 1963. There are other buildings and sites within the Gandhi Ashram known as Nandini, Vinoba Kutir, Upasana Mandir, and Magan Niwas. These buildings are named after people who were close to Gandhi.</p>
